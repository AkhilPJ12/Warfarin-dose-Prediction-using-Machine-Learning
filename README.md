# Warfarin Dose Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the appropriate dosage of Warfarin, an anticoagulant, for patients based on their clinical and genetic information. The prediction is made using machine learning techniques implemented in Python.

## Features
- Utilizes clinical and genetic data to personalize Warfarin dosage recommendations.
- Machine learning models for predicting optimal dosage based on patient-specific information.
- User-friendly interface for inputting patient data and obtaining dosage predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language for implementing machine learning models and data processing.
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
- **Web Framework (Optional):** Flask or Django for creating a web-based user interface.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Install Python (https://www.python.org/).
- Set up a virtual environment.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Warfarin-Dose-Prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Warfarin-Dose-Prediction`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage
1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. Access the application in a web browser: `http://localhost:5000` (if using Flask/Django).

## Dataset
- The project uses a dataset containing clinical and genetic information of patients who have been administered Warfarin.

## Model Training
- Machine learning models are trained on historical data to predict optimal Warfarin dosage.
- The training process involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
